# Abstract:

This project analyzes Apple Inc.'s stock prices from July 1985 to 2024, spanning over 9,765 trading days. The dataset includes notable product releases such as 21 iPhone models and 25 MacBook models. It explores the financial implications of key innovations like the M1 and M2 chips, reflecting Apple’s strategic market shifts.

The goal is to predict Apple’s stock closing price using advanced time-series forecasting models, capturing trends and patterns influenced by external and internal factors such as product launches and market events.


# Problem Statement:

The financial market's dynamic nature makes stock price prediction a complex yet essential task for investors. This project aims to develop a robust time-series forecasting model to predict Apple’s stock prices using various approaches to identify temporal dependencies and market trends.


# Dataset:

The dataset includes:

Apple stock prices from 1985 to 2024.

Key milestones, including iPhone and MacBook release dates.

Market trends around global events like COVID-19.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Key observations from EDA:

COVID-19 Impact:

Significant decline in stock prices followed by a volatile recovery, reflecting market responses to global events.


Product Launch Influence:

Stock fluctuations align with major iPhone and MacBook releases.

Successful launches (e.g., iPhone 11) correlate with sharp price increases, while less successful ones (e.g., iPhone 12) show declines.


Seasonality:

Stock prices are typically higher from September to December and January to March due to holiday sales and product launches.


# Models Implemented:

LSTM with XGBoost & Voting Regressor:

Combines LSTM layers for temporal dependencies and XGBoost for robust non-linear predictions, with an ensemble voting mechanism.


LSTM with Lagged Features & Hyperparameter Tuning:

Adds lagged features for context, tuned for optimal LSTM units and dropout rates.


LSTM with Transfer Learning:

Utilizes pre-trained models, fine-tuned for improved performance.


Prophet:

Open-source library for interpretable time-series forecasting.


ARIMA & SARIMA:

Classical statistical models for trend and seasonality adjustments.
